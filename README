Simple project with SpecFlow integrated

You will need to install SpecFlow locally in order to have it's Feature and Spec templates available through Visual Studio.
http://specflow.org/downloads/installer.aspx

How to use SpecFlow
* Create a new X.feature file
* Add a feature description
* Add scenarios that apply to this feature 
* For each scenario add the relevant steps by using Gherkin( https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin )
* Add a X.steps file, this will have some sample methods inside, delete them.
* Run tests, you will see your scenario and it will fail.
* Specflow will provide feedback when you haven't defined your steps by showing you what code you need to add in your steps file.
* Copy each code fragment for each step and add it to your steps file.
* Fill the steps with the appropriate behaviour.

If your test dll is configured to run with specflow.exe you can get html or xml reports that you can integrated to CI procedures.
